## Dogs

Wee furry friends are generally more than welcome during the weekend!
Unfortunately, Strathclyde Union and Dream Machine don't allow dogs.

## LEZ

Glasgow runs a Low Emission Zone (LEZ). The [LEZ rules](https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/LEZ)
state that non-compliant vehicles will face a penalty charge, initially Â£60
and doubling with every subsequent breach.
