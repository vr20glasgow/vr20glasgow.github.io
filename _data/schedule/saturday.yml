      Keen beans can pop over to the nearby Queen's park baptist church
      for coffee (with plant milks), cake and some stretching, lead by Charlotte [name].
      Come along and try out some of our VRs favourite cake recipes (or possibly
      store-bought cakes, depending on how busy folk are around then).

      To soothe out your aches and pains, we'll be running two guided stretching
      sessions from 10:15-11:00 and 11:00-11:30. This needs to be pre-booked
      as the church has a limited capacity.

      To kick off the festivities, we'll start with a ceilidh! No need to be
      embarrassed as I can almost guarantee at least one of the committee
      members is a worse dancer than you.

      The night owls amongst us will relax after dinner with some funky tunes
      and smooth beverages. The early birds will no doubt be getting their Zs
      in for the morning run!
